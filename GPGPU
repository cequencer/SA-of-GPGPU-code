GPGPU發展與限制、應用，作者解決了很大的排程和中斷的問題
the GPU can't be hard real time because of the bus speed between CPU & GPU and not able to support preemption ~2011(maybe preemption IS supported after 2011)

A Performance Analysis Framework for Identifying Potential Benefits in GPGPU Applications

Cache Effect: Recent GPGPU architectures such as NVIDIA’s
Fermi GPGPUs have a hardware-managed cache memory hierarchy.
Since the baseline model does not model cache effects, the
total memory cycles are determined by multiplying memory requests
and the average global memory latency. We simply model
the cache effect by calculating average memory access latency
(AMAT); the total memory cycles are calculated by multiplying
memory requests and AMAT.
