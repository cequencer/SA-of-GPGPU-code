Real-World Constraints of GPUs in Real-Time Systems(they solve some interrupt & scheduling problems)
the GPU can't be hard real time because of the bus speed between CPU & GPU and not able to support preemption ~2011(maybe preemption IS supported after 2011)

A Performance Analysis Framework for Identifying Potential Benefits in GPGPU Applications

NVIDIA’s Fermi GPGPUs have a hardware-managed cache memory hierarchy.
The total memory cycles are calculated by multiplying memory requests and AMAT.
AMAT = avg DRAM lat × miss ratio + hit lat (12)
avg DRAM lat = DRAM lat + (avg trans warp − 1) × Δ.

Estimating the WCET of GPU-Accelerated Applications Using Hybrid Analysis

the associativity and replacement policies of the cache, the pipeline depth, and how exactly threads are scheduled on NVIDIA GPUs all remain undisclosed. 
->modelling the hardware and its associated run-time support is infeasible. 
->Our solution is to use hybrid techniques [10], [11] that can, in principle, avoid hardware modelling.

On Static Timing Analysis of GPU Kernels

In describing our WCET estimation method, we concentrate on features related to the SIMT
execution model and omit the other features (e.g., pipelines and caches).
